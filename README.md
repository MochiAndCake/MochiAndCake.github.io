<h1>Summary</h1>

This respository uses GitHub Pages to host my website. The website can be found at: https://mochiandcake.github.io/


<h2>Why am I making this?</h2>

I have been fascinated by user interfaces (UI) recently. After witnessing a lot of coworkers struggle with bad UI, I learned how important UI is. So, partly why I am making this website is to motivate myself to learn about UI and for fun.

Other than those reasons, a UI course I am taking requires us to host the lab work, so I thought it would be nice to include them here as well.


<h2>Future Plans</h2>

In the future, I want to look into adding the REACT framework to the existing pages and new.

I have taught myself some basic JavaScript but have much more to learn from my courses. I want to incorporate some JavaScript scripts to make the webpages more interactive.
